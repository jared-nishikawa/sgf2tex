;B[ep]C[I opt for high approach to help counter whites 4th line framework.  Leela agrees, with 75%+ effort going onto e4.

;W[hp]C[wide pincer from white aims to continue building a high, influence based moyo. 
]

(;B[en]C[1 point jump is never wrong, or so they say...

d7 might have been preferable, however. 
]

;W[cm]C[2 point jump on 3rd line is usually ok, but this feels a bit slack to me for some reason.
]

(;B[el]C[Using miai to pressure. I get to threaten to block white in at c9 or counter attack h4.  

Leela again prefers leaning harder on the left side with d8. 
]

;W[ck]C[white prefers not to be blocked in, so I get to turn my attention to h4. 
]

;B[kp]C[I chose a wide counter pincer.  I'm aiming to either approach the corner o3 or attack h4 further.  
]

(;W[mp]C[white blocks from the right, again very high.  I think this would be better on the 3rd line.  Leela agrees, suggesting n3.  
]

(;B[lo]C[I was hoping to pressure the right and keep sente to attack h4, but this was misguided.  

Leela does not even consider this move, opting for the simple 1 point jump.  White 
]

(;W[jo]C[leela prefers h7.  this move doesn't accomplish much for white.


]

(;B[iq]C[leela believes this idea was correct (cut under) but that the direct attachment at k4 would be stronger. 
]

(;W[hn]
;B[hq]C[I cut under, making a base and moving towards connecting my groups.  I'm pretty happy with this result. 
]

;W[hl]
;B[dj]C[white runs, and I apply pressure on the left to continue the attack. 
]

;W[ek]C[This looks like a mistake to me.  Leela suggests push at d9 and cut to avoid the ladder.

(;B[co]C[in retrospect, I think this was a mistake. I ended up getting less good shape than I should have given white's blunder. 
]

;W[bo]
;B[dp]
;W[cq]
;B[fk]C[I end of getting quite a bit of thickness facing white's weak center group.  I felt good about this result at the time, though I still think I could have gotten more from it. 

leela thinks I should have omitted the moves at c5 and d4, which ultimately just gave my opponent better shape in the corner. 
]

;W[hj]
;B[fi]
;W[hh]
;B[gg]C[at this point, c10 has become VERY big.  I was eyeing it in the game but felt I needed to counteract white's growing influence.  However, I think I ultimately waited too long. 
]

;W[lm]C[white decides to cap me and try to build a moyo in the center.  this is likely the wrong direction.  building territory with a framework like this is usually ineffecient.  

However it is a big area he's threatening, so I decide I must invade. 
]

;B[qn]C[maybe a high move would have been better in this case.  
]

;W[qo]

;B[oo]
;W[op]
;B[mo]C[I was pretty pleased with this connection sequence.
]

;W[ol]C[this move is gote for white, and tries too hard to build territory in the center.  white should have played c10 or j14 for a pure territorial play, or invaded deeper. 
]

(;B[if]C[Leela likes this move, and gives j14 a 56% winrate.

however, c10 also rates very highly, and looking back I still feel this might have been the best timing to take it. 
]

;W[cc]C[a good probe. 
]

(;B[bc]C[leela prefers the block on the other side. 
]

;W[dc]
;B[fc]C[white tenukis here, but this was maybe premature. 
]

(;W[cj]
(;B[ch]C[I was concerned about white connecting out with a sacrifice in the corner, but this move leaves very nasty aji for the future. 
]

(;W[jg]C[white decides to leave the corner aji and move to the center again.

this move is slow, however, and gives black sente to fix his shape. 
]

(;B[mf]C[unfortunately, I got greedy, and played a very slack move.  while this threatens white's center, it is far too much for BLack to hope for white to play defensively with something like n12.  I had wanted to make white defend, then push at k14, sealing off a huge side, but this was far too ambitious. 
]

;W[jc]C[white's response is very clever, aiming to attach and sacrifice some stones to get a living invasion, or connect out. 
]

;B[jd]
;W[kd]
;B[kc]
;W[jb]
;B[kb]
;W[bb]C[I fell into white's trap.  I now cannot both kill the corner and his invasion. 
]

;B[bd]
(;W[eb]
(;B[fb]
;W[ab]C[white is alive, and I'm in deep trouble.  White now has several ways to destroy my center territory, and I still have lots of Aji on my bottom groups.  There is way too much to do, and too little time. 

My winrate according to leela has dropped rom almost 60% when I played j14 to under 50%.  I'm behind. 

]

;B[mm]C[So, I embark on a bold plan. I need to make several things happen in sente in order to have a chance.  This probe starts the gambit, and allows me to threaten the corner without worrying about getting cut at o5.
]

;W[ml]
;B[qq]C[with this invasion, I am threatening to either come under with s5, or peep at o3. white is in a tricky position, as his stones may not survive if he loses his base. 
]

;W[qp]
;B[nq]
;W[np]
;B[pr]
;W[or]
;B[rr]C[This exchange was extremely tense, as I wasn't certain I would build life.
]

;W[pq]
;B[rp]
;W[ro]
;B[sq]
;W[rm]C[here, white bungles badly, as I had hoped.  THe threat of cutting off his white stones had him running scared, and he escapes, but gives up sente. 

Now I've destroyed his corner and am free to continue the attack!

note that leela still gives me only a 40% winrate.  I'm still deep in the woods. 
]

;B[ec]C[Another gambit.  I am hoping against hope that white makes a mistake here, and gives up sente again.  THere are several ways he can make life, but only a few end with him being contained, and my retaining sente. 
]

;W[ca]C[lucky! white chooses a shape that looks good, but has major flaws. 
]

;B[db]
;W[ea]
;B[dd]
;W[cb]C[This way, I get to seal him in with sente, and can press the attack!

The win % swung from 40% to 53% on this exchange.  It is such a small thing, but sente is so, so important.  these are the moves that are easy to miss, but can determine the outcome of a game.

;B[fa]
;W[da]
;B[lh]C[my rear secured, it is time to fight!  it's a close game, and will hinge on the next exchanges. 
]

;W[lg]
;B[mg]
;W[mh]
;B[kg]C[I don't think white expected this when he played m13, but I had read it out.  Leela gives this move 58%. I'm back in the game!
]

;W[li]
;B[kh]
;W[ki]
;B[jh]
;W[ji]
;B[ih]
;W[ii]C[white ends up playing for the center with a nice wrap.  I could have secured my side here, but I was still very worried about the aji at the d10 stones.  

I felt like with the size of white's center, I needed to get d2, d11, and s16 to stay ahead.  
]

(;B[nh]
;W[mi]
;B[ko]
;W[kn]
;B[gp]C[I tried a few probing moves to retain sente, but overplayed my hand.  White isn't going to respond to save h4, even though I could kill it.  This was a blunder. 
]

;W[ig]C[white takes advantage of my aji

(;W[jf]C[this was silly.  why not atari first?

;B[fg]
;W[rd]C[good sente move.  white should now turn back to d11. 
]

]

;B[of]

;B[nf]C[here I was hoping to trap white if he got greedy. 
]

(;W[oh]C[alas white, saw through it. 

leela has a better solution, though: s17
]

;B[lq]C[sente. if I connect n4 I can also threaten to cut p3.  maybe white can ignore though if he plays something like d11. 
]

;W[mq]
;B[di]C[looking at the endgame, I think I'm ahead by a handful of points, so I decide to connect. 

Much to my surprise, white resigns!

The final score is within 2-3 points, I think, with a good endgame, but perhaps my opponent didn't see a way through. 

leela gives black at 75% winrate in this position, so perhaps the resignation is reasonable, though still early from a human Kyu perspective. 

Overall, a well fought game with many subtle turning points!  

I continue to struggle with leaving too much aji and being greedy for points when I don't need to be.  I need to learn to play more solidly and that defense is a good offense. 

gg!
