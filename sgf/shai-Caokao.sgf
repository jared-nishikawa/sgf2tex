I decided that I would play the calmest, sturdiest, patientest moves I could find, and not worry if I won or lost.  Simply play calmly and sturdy.  I will try to count all the moves I thought were very much on the slow side]RE[B+Resign]

;B[cd]BL[49.49]
;W[fq]WL[55.734]C[Here, I could pincer, or even tenuki, but the calm move is to simply respond, as if I'm giving white what he wants..
]
;B[cn]BL[46.045]C[Calm move #1]
;W[ip]WL[53.63]LB[qp:A]C[I could approach at A... I could

OR, I could play calmly and simply extend down the right side, which is an important place for black and white

I want to avoid ALL fights.  Since white is fighting against a handicap, he WANTS to drag the game into a fight]

;B[pf]BL[30.58]C[#3]
;W[gc]WL[33.37]LB[qp:A]C[Interesting play by white, but I do get it... it now makes the left side important both sides

I also desperately wanted to get in at A, but... slow moves this game.  Slow, patient, calm, sturdy.]
;B[dj]BL[19.598]
;W[qp]WL[17.435]LB[ee:A]C[I am now very much eyeing A, since white could easily get in and reduce some area... A would make a very strong shape in the upper left]

We'll mark the last three moves as #5]
