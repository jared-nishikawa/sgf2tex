jtf4 [1k\]: Greetings from London

Ok, so this ended up being kind of a quick game, though not intentionally.  I get nervous playing other 1k, since I have trouble believing that I am as strong as them, but my current goal is to abolish that disbelief, and have firm confidence that not only am I as strong as 1k, but stronger than that, and that I have the potential to be even stronger.

So, anyway, that's the mindset.  I have to BELIEVE that I am strong enough.

As black, I considered playing either 3-4 or 4-4.  When I open on 3-4, my games tend to become complicated, which I like, but since I'm planning on an attacking strategy, I decided to play 4-4.]RE[B+13.50]
;B[pd]BL[582.989]
;W[ec]WL[598.5]C[Changes my strategy the tiniest bit, I guess.  However, since my plan is to embark on either the Kobayashi or the Chinese opening, this 3-5 stone by white doesn't change that, so I continued with the 3-4 in the bottom right.]
;B[pq]BL[569.958]
;W[nc]WL[597.371]LB[jd:A]C[Unusual, for sure.  I can of course take the empty corner, but then white will get a double approach.  I'm not really a fan of that idea, so I figure I'll respond and see what white does.  If white plays A, then I'll take the empty corner, and if white takes the empty corner, I'll take sente to play a pincer or something.]
;B[qf]BL[557.305]
;W[jd]WL[595.915]C[So I take the empty corner.  I'm not too unhappy with this opening, although it is unusual.]
;B[cp]BL[554.093]LB[qo:A][eq:B]C[Not bad.  I like that white is consolidated to the top, while I have stones in three corners.  Furthermore, I have plans to develop at A or B.

I guess if I were white, I would play around A...]
;W[fp]WL[593.494]LB[pp:A][nq:B]C[White is full of surprises today.  Kind of an unusual strategy.  If my Q3 stone were at A, I could see white making a double purpose approach at B, but the way it is, I don't see what white has to gain]

;W[fo]WL[590.931]LB[jp:A][jq:B][kq:C]C[Standard moves...  at this point I could extend along the left side, but I feel more like attacking, which is why I played a pincer.  I considered A, B, and C.]
;B[jp]BL[512.107]
;W[dn]WL[587.483]C[My corner feels strong, so I think I'm safe if I cut... I don't really know what will happen after that though, but I know white's groups are not safe yet.]
