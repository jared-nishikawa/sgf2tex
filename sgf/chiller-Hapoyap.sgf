chiller [2d\]: hi

It's been a while since I fully reviewed a game.  I spent some time being discouraged about not improving at go, but then I read through (and I mean really *read* through) Graded Go for Dan Players vol 1 (life and death) again, and it really hammered home to me just how important reading is in this game.  (As well as other things)

1. Reading is THE way to get better.  The ONLY way.  Reading reading reading.  Getting used to doing a dozen or so problems a day is an important exercise.  Reading reading reading.  Then the hard problems become doable, and the easy problems become second nature.

READING is how I'm going to find my way into the dan ranks.  ...which I am very set on doing.  I can do this.  Little by little.

2. I have to change my attitude.  I have to BELIEVE, like really believe, that I am a strong player.  I must must must have confidence in my go.  When I play stronger players, there seems to be this mental separation of "Strong players" and "me."

This causes me to lose my focus in handicap games, usually.

I must believe that I am as strong as them, and that losses are simply learning tools.  If I was winning all the time, it would mean I wasn't playing people strong enough to beat me.  It is a privilege to play strong players, because then I get to learn from them and get stronger myself.

I must believe in myself.

3. I can't let myself get too attached to the outcomes.  I win some games, and I lose some games.  What's important is that each game, I try to learn something new, and try to apply the skills I've been learning from practicing my reading in problem books.

Also, that means I have to CONTINUE reading the books.  It seems that I have taken a bit of a break for the last week or so, but that's OK!!!  I spent the three weeks before that concentrating every day on life and death problems, so I'm taking a bit of a break to let all that practice absorb in, and to cool off, and now I've been at the top of my game this past week, playing some of the best (consistent) go of my life!!  The practice has PAID OFF!

And also, I've just realized that it might be cool someday to make a training plan for go.  For example:
	3 weeks: only life and death, a dozen problems a day
	1 week: only observe
	1 week:
		play ONE serious game each day (30min)
		play ONE decompress game each day (not allowed to worry about whether you win or lose)
		review ONE game

	1 week: Rest

Anyway, let's review this game!]RE[B+Forfeit]
;W[qp]WL[291.764]LB[cd:A][dd:B]C[Thoughts.

If I play A, I break up the symmetry of the board a little bit, and makes it more interesting (and potentially confusing), which is often desirable in close games.

However, B lets me try to overwhelm white with my influence game.  I was thinking that if I play B, I have to commit to an aggressive attack strategy if I needed to.

I was thinking that I was OK with that.]
;B[dd]BL[287.747]C[So here I go
]
;W[fq]WL[289.833]LB[ip:A][hq:B]C[Correct place for white to start, I think.

I thought for a minute about playing a pincer (A or B), but decided that white would nimbly get away (A) or find an easy way of blunting my influence if I played B.  I'm starting to see why the knight move response is so popular.  It's stable, strong, and flexible (meaning it keeps your options open even after it's played)

Appreciating the value of this move is a learning tool]
;B[cn]BL[269.641]
;W[kq]WL[287.419]LB[jp:A]C[I've wondered if this is a bit low, but I guess it works ok with his stone in the lower right.

I wonder if I would have played A?  Still, it's important to make sure you get territory in a handicap game, so I get it.

For the early part of this game, I was trying to put myself in white's shoes:
"How would I play if I were playing a handicap game against a weaker player?"

Still, since I've been playing so high, as white I would have played A to maintain the balance of influence.  I wouldn't play a shoulder hit like A immediately, but I like having that option open for later.]
;B[jd]BL[258.118]LB[dj:A][cn:B]TR[fq]C[I debated between this and A for a while.  I decided that since B was low, I had better prospects at the top.  That was my instinct at the time, but now I see a bit more clearly a better reason: if black 6 is at A, then it looks like it would have been wiser to pincer in response to white triangle.

That is, if I had played A, black 4 would look like a bad move.]
;W[qf]WL[284.829]C[Pincering feels much more natural here]
;B[pi]BL[249.345]LB[qh:A]TR[qp]C[I had thought about pincering at A, but since white's triangle stone is low, there seemed to be little opportunity* for territory on the right.

To put this into words, a good "opportunity" in my mind is a move that evokes some sort of response from white while making territory at the same time.  How threatening it is to white changes the value of the move, certainly.

Anyway, played high]
;W[of]WL[278.77]LB[nd:A]C[A is natural.]
;B[nd]BL[247.03]
;W[ni]WL[276.54]LB[mf:J][pg:B][nh:A][oh:G][nj:H][nk:F][ok:I][pk:C][pl:D][ql:E]C[This took me very much by surprise.  I spent a good two minutes on my response because I really didn't want to start this game off with a pointless loss

I really wanted to play A, but it seemed like it didn't work.  Then I thought about playing B first, but it still didn't seem very good for me.

I thought about C, D, and E, but it all seemed very passive to me.  For example, if I play C, then white plays F, and I've just let white jump around and get a lot of useful stones out there.  (Which apparently, I don't want)

I thought about playing F myself.
Clearly G is out.
I thought H, but it seemed too dangerous if white cuts.
Also I seemed thin.  The main problem was this: I wanted some way to make Q11 stronger so I could leave myself open the option of cutting with B and A later.  But I wanted to be active about it.

So I think that's right when I saw J.  I only looked at it for a few seconds and I realized it was the only move that made sense to me.]
(;B[mf]BL[172.775]LB[ng:A][oh:B][pk:C][pl:D]C[I think it might only have been AFTER I played it that I thought about this added benefit:
	If white plays around A or B to block me in, THEN I'll play C or D
	If white plays around C or D, I'll do the peep-and-cut that I was thinking about earlier]
;W[qc]WL[258.794]C[So that's why this move surprised me.]
;B[qd]BL[170.513]C[The only move.]
;W[rd]WL[257.087]LB[pc:B][re:A]TR[of][qf][ni][pi]C[Now here I get to pause again.

If I play A, I should make sure I have an attack on the white stones after I get my wall.  The problem is that my one black triangle stone is outnumbered by the white triangle stones.  I won't have much of an attack.]

(;W[nf]WL[241.096]
(;B[oi]BL[140.961]TR[mf]C[Of course, black triangle means nothing to me now.  I could probably even ignore white's push]

;W[lf]WL[235.608]
;B[kg]BL[134.922]

;B[ph]BL[120.551]
;W[me]WL[229.316]
;B[lc]BL[117.693]C[Is it slow?  I felt like I needed to defend my group in the top right.  This may have been slow, but it was steady, and I felt good playing it.]
;W[dg]WL[226.341]LB[fc:C][fd:B][cf:D][ef:A]C[Another unexpected move.  A bit too far away, maybe?  It will be easy for black to take the whole top, no?

I thought about A, B, C, and D, but settled on B, which seemed calm]
;B[fd]BL[100.92]
;W[cl]WL[221.787]LB[dr:A][er:B]C[A is normal of course, but am I capitulating too much to white's wishes?  I thought about B too, but didn't want to make white stronger.]
;B[dr]BL[94.378]
;W[er]WL[219.488]C[This also surprised me, but in review, it makes sense.  It's sente and it makes white some points.  Plus, it's easy for black to make a mistake.]
;B[eq]BL[84.198]
;W[fr]WL[217.683]LB[cq:A]C[I see white's plan now.  He's aiming at A.  It's sort of OK, because he has a weak group on the left, so it'll be hard to invade.

Then I thought that if I invade first, it'll give me an out for if/when white invades at A]
;B[cj]BL[79.402]LB[el:C][dm:B][cq:A]C[So it seemed like a good time to invade

I expected white to play B or C]
;W[cd]WL[213.981]C[A surprise, but I sense now that white is trying to make things complicated.  I tried to play calmly]

;W[de]WL[210.487]LB[dc:H][ec:I][ed:A][hd:J][ee:B][ef:C][ff:D][gf:F][fg:E][dk:G]C[I debated over A and B.  I've only seen A in stronger players' games, and I was trying to come up for a reason to play it.

Here's what I came up with:
	If I play B-white C-black D-white E-black F, white builds up strength before attacking at G.
	White also has the option of playing something annoying like H or I, and paired with the weakness at J, B seemed unacceptable]
;B[ed]BL[67.668]C[I feel like white has pushed me around a little bit, but I have come out with quite a bit of territory at the top, so I deem it ok.  Plus white's group is not completely safe yet]
;W[gf]WL[202.267]LB[hd:C][he:B][ef:F][ff:E][ej:D][dk:A]C[This surprised me a little bit, but it makes sense.  White still needs to build up strength before attacking strongly on the left.  (if he started by playing A, I would push up and slice white's groups in two.

But now the question is: do I need to defend my weakness at the top?  And if so, should I play B or C?

I really wanted to play D, but then I wondered about white playing C
	I thought: could I then play E and F and then cut?  But I would then be cut into two weak groups, which is not what I'm trying to do right now.  So, B is my choice]
;B[he]BL[43.667]
;W[hf]WL[197.058]C[White may have lost a little ground here.  I think he should have attacked on the left instead of extending.  I think he was expecting (by reflex) that I would respond to this, and he knows he's made a mistake after I play my jump on the left]
;B[ej]BL[37.664]
(;W[el]WL[195.243]LB[hc:B][hd:A][gj:D][dk:E][bl:C]C[He only looked at this for a second before playing the one space jump.  I think he was thrown off balance a little bit by losing the initiative.

Here was my thought: if white plays A, then I play B and I should have no problem connecting.  Anything else seems similarly simple to answer.

I currently have the option of C or D.  If I play C, white will almost certainly play E to cut me.  But really, that's ok, and I'd rather be able to connect while it's still a guarantee]

;W[dh]WL[185.703]LB[fi:A]C[This surprised me though.

I could have played A, but I didn't like the idea of getting cut through on the side.]

(;B[fg]BL[30]OB[3]C[I'm offering a trade here.  If white blocks at H10, he can take the center and part of the top.  But I'll get a HUGE left side, no weak groups, and probably sente too]

You know, white probably could have kept playing if he was feeling particularly stubborn.  Often stronger players keep playing from a losing position, because they are not 100% convinced the situation is bleak.  Here though, because of the way I played this game, white knows that there is no way I'll let up on him for even a second.  That's why he resigned.
