;W[hq]LB[cj:B][jq:A]C[I don't agree with this move.

White will have limited potential on the bottom because of by Q3 stone.

Perhaps white wanted to keep me from getting the kobayashi opening, but the thing is that the kobayashi opening is a popular opening BECAUSE it's good for both sides.  I think white has lost something here.

Furthermore, white doesn't have stones at A or B, so pincering will lead to a wall that doesn't work very efficiently]

;W[np]LB[po:A][qo:C][nr:B]C[A good start probably.

I considered A, B, and C, but thought C was too low...
B seems ok, but not on a large enough scale.]
;B[po]
;W[nn]C[I think jumping out here and letting me take 4th line territory is dangerous.

If he continues like this, he'll end up with ONE big territory that could be slowly reduced]
;B[pm]C[Having been allowed to jump out twice on the 4th line, I feel satisfied.  More than satisfied really...

I feel like I've gotten a little extra, meaning that it feels safe to allow a slow, sturdy move later on.]
;W[oq]
;B[pr]LB[io:C][ip:B][hq:A]C[jrhoak: ugh moyo games are haaaard

Even Josh knew at this point that this would be a hard game for him.  I think the reason is the pincer he played on move 6!!

Another problem is that since A is low, I'll be able to play B or C, which will feel good, to force him into a low position]

A, B, C or D, and E, so four choices (counting C or D as one) about getting in.

A, B, and C can all be characterized as Josh playing overly aggressively.  He should make a concession so he can gain points elsewhere.]

This might have been a mistake... but it would've been painful to let me play on the 4th line again.  The problem is that it's not really sente... no good followup]

;W[jk]LB[dk:A][pk:B]TR[lq][mq]C[jarstar: Interesting...

Ok, now I see that A and B were indirectly attacking the group in the middle.  Strange that I didn't really see those as threats... (and since I didn't die, I guess I wasn't wrong?

Still, this is a beautifully coordinated attack by white.  I have to admire it.

My saving grace is the two triangle stones which still have lots of potential.]
